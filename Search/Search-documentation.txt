The Search APIs provide access to the search technology that power Bing.com and a long list of 1st-party (Office, Cortana, Xbox, Edge) and 3rd-party (AOL, Apple, Amazon, Yahoo etc.) partners. 
In total, we have 4 Search APIs for web, image, video and news search. 
In addition we provide access to our Autosuggest (type-ahead) and Spell Check services. 

Bing Web Search API: is the main Search API. 
With one programmatic call, the user can get back relevant webpage, image, video, and news results. 
It's equivalent to searching in the web vertical in bing.com. 
The Search APIs provide the power of the Bing Search engine to developers. 
You get access to many of the latest and greatest capabilities the bing.com site has to offer, in the form of an API. 
It's the same architecture stack so it's a powerful way to bring the knowledge and intelligence of the search engine to your own experience. 
The API is built directly on top of the entire Bing stack- you get the quality, relevance, performance and continuous improvements that the rest of the site gets. 
Similar to Bing.com- tail queries, or obscure terms may have limited results. 
We're always working to improve the edge cases though and API users will benefit from that.
